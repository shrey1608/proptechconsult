# From Classroom Ideas to Provisional Patents

We guide students in turning their creative ideas into viable inventions with the help of in-house patent lawyers and industrial experts who collectively hold over 100 patents. Our program includes interactive workshops and personalized sessions to refine and develop their concepts.

We also provide comprehensive support in filing provisional patents with the USPTO, protecting students' inventions early and setting the stage for future patent achievements.
